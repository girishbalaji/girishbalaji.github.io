        <a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs194-26/fa18/hw/proj4/">(Project Web Page)</a>
        : smooth face morphing, population averaging, and caricature creation </i>

    </div>



    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>In this project, I morphed one face to another, used a population dataset to get the average image that represents the dataset, used the average to develop a facial caricature with exaggerated facial features, and used a subpopulation of smiling people to convert my neutral face to a smile (and vice versa)!</p>

    <p>What is an image warp? Basically, if we want to morph one image into another, we need to map and transform the featurews from the original image to the position in the destination image in a continuous fashion, and then dissolve the colors from each color continuously as well.

    <h2>Morphing</h2>
    For the next three parts I morphed a picture of me (on the left) to the CEO of Microsoft, Satya Nadella (on the right). I chose to morph myself into him because I worked at Microsoft recently while he's in charge, share ethnic and facial similarities, and believe he's an all around awesome guy!

    <h4>Me and Satya Nadella</h4>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <b>Me</b>
        <img src="data/edited_me_glasses.jpeg">
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <b>Satya</b>
        <img src="data/edited_satya.jpeg">
      </div>
    </div>


    <h3> Part 1: Defining Correspondences </h3>

    <p>This part of the project required me to select points along the key features like my nose, jaw line etc. in my image, and then get the exact same corresponding points in Satya's image. This was a very manual process, but I wrote code to store and backup these points as I select them. Here's how they turned out.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <b>Me</b>
        <img src="output/point_reference_me_glasses.jpeg">
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <b>Satya</b>
        <img src="output/point_reference_satya.jpeg">
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Notice how the ordering of the points in each of the photos matches in each of the pictures. Here is the Delaunay triangulation of each of the images. The Delaunay triangulation is the set of triangles connecting a set of points with the minimum perimeter. Here's what they look like on both my and Satya's face</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <b>Me with Traingulation</b>
        <img src="output/Delaunay_me_glasses.jpeg">
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <b>Satya with Triangulation</b>
        <img src="output/Delaunay_satya.jpeg">
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <b>Mean Triangulation with My Face as Reference</b>
        <img src="output/Delaunay_mean_me_with_glasses_satya.jpeg">
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Part 2: Computing the Midway Face</h3>
    <p>The midway face requires finding average shape (i.e. the average of all the points selected on both images), transforming each triangle on the source and destination onto the corresponding triangle in the halfway image, and then averaging the colors from each triangle.</p>

    <p>I usesd the `draw_polygon` function and defined my own affine transformation that maps one triangle to another to get a pixel mapping for each pixel in the halfway image</p>

    <p>I put the original images from the top as reference. You can see how well they're blended</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-xs-6">
        <b>Me</b>
        <img src="data/edited_me_glasses.jpeg">
      </div>
      <div class="col-xs-6">
        <b>Satya</b>
        <img src="data/edited_satya.jpeg">
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-12">
        <b>Me and Satya Morphed: Who's who?</b>
        <img src="output/avg_me_glasses_satya.jpeg">
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>This turned out better than I expected and I really cannot identify who was the 'source' image. It looks like a prietty good blend of me and CEO of Microsoft!</p>

    <h3>Part 3: Morph Sequence</h3>
    <p>The goal of this question is effectively to define the morph function, so that we are able to generate an image that is some fraction of the source image, and also a fraction of the destination image.</p>

    <p>Here's a few example of the individual frames that we outputed before I show you a cool GIF</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <b>t ~ 1/4</b>
        <img src="output/me_glasses_satya/10.jpg">
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <b>t ~ 1/2</b>
        <img src="output/me_glasses_satya/20.jpg">
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <b>t ~ 3/4</b>
        <img src="output/me_glasses_satya/30.jpg">
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>And now here's the GIF for submission</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-12">
        <b>The Transformation from Me to Satya</b>

      </div>
    </div>

    <p>And a cooler back and forth loop</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-12">

      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Part 4: The "Mean Face" of a Population</h3>
    <p>The main goal of this part is to find the average image of many images. The theory behind this section is the same as that in part 2 where we averaged two images, except instead of taking the average of two, we're taking the average of many images, when we get the new points.</p>


    <p>I used the Danish face dataset that had several danish images. They were mostly of white men but there were some women. The Danish dataset came with a list of all the key points in a text file. I had to parse it. Here's an example of what it looks like below: </p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-12">
        <b>Danish example</b>
        <img src="output/annotated_dane_example.jpg">
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>The blue points are the marked key points that wer provided.</p>

    <h4>Part 4.1: Compute the average face shape of the danes</h4>
    <p>First I had to take the average of all these special marked points. Here's what the average points of all the images look like relative to one sample image</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-12">
        <b>Average special marked points for all the Danes</b>
        <img src="output/avg_dane_points.jpeg">
      </div>
    </div>
    <p> Part 4.2 is after 4.3 where I show the morph from some of the Danish people into the average</p>

    <h4>Part 4.3: Average Face of the Population</h4>
    <p>Here's what the average Danish person looks like </p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-12">
        <b>Average Danish person</b>
        <img src="output/avg_dane.jpg">
      </div>
    </div>

    <h4>Part 4.2: Morph Each of the Faces In the Dataset to the Average</h4>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <b>Example 1</b>

      </div>
    </div>

    <h4>Part 4.4: Morph of my face into the average geometry and back</h4>
    <p>Doing this took quite a bit of work from remapping the points on my phase and running the morphing function again</p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-12">
        <b>Dealunay of the average dane</b>
        <img src="output/Delaunay_avg_dane.jpeg">

      <div class="col-sm-12">
        <b>Dealunay of the mean of the average dane and me (my image)</b>
        <img src="output/Delaunay_dane_me_mean.jpeg">

    <div class="row">

    </div>

    <p> Here is what I would have looked like if I were half danish! </p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-12">
        <b>Half indian half danish</b>
        <img src="output/avg_avg_dane_me_no_glasses_for_dane.jpeg">
      </div>
    </div>

<h3>Part 5</h3>
<p>Based on the mean of the Danish, we can use the mean structure to emphasize certain features in my own orginal image. Basically, I take my current special points, and then add the scaled difference from me and the average Dane to my image.</p>
<p>Here's what the caricature looks like: </p>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">
    <b>aricature with Accentuated Danish Features</b>
    <img src="output/caricatures/caricature_avg_dane_me_no_glasses_for_dane.jpeg">
  </div>
</div>

<p>While I was debugging this code, I actually generated some pretty cool caricature like images. Check them out!</p>

<h3>[Bells and Whistles]: Part 6: Adding a smile</h3>
<p>For the final part of this project, I decided to try to take my neutral face and add a good smile to it.</p>

<p>I can fine tune the alpha parameter as I show below. With a high alpha value, there is a higher effect of the smile on the original image. With a lower or negative alpha value, it takes away the smile...and you can kind of see a frown!</p>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">
    <b>Alpha = 0 (no added smile effect)</b>
    <img src="output/more_smiling_alpha_0.jpg">

  <div class="col-sm-12">
    <b>Alpha = 4 (high smile effect)</b>
